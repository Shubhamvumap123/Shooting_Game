## 2024-05-23 - Content Security Policy (CSP) Implementation
**Vulnerability:** Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) in `public/index.html`. This absence allows potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks if a vulnerability were to be introduced in the application code or dependencies.
**Learning:** React applications, especially those using `react-scripts` and inline styles for dynamic content (like the canvas background in this game), require a carefully crafted CSP. Specifically, `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` was necessary because the application sets the background image of the canvas element using an inline `style` attribute in `src/App.js`. While `unsafe-inline` is generally discouraged, it is a necessary compromise here to maintain functionality without significant refactoring (e.g., moving dynamic styles to a class or using CSS variables).
**Prevention:** Always include a CSP meta tag in `public/index.html` for client-side applications. Start with a strict policy and relax it only as needed (e.g., allowing `data:` for images bundled by webpack, and `unsafe-inline` for styles if unavoidable).
